This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install NodeJS if you don't already have it. [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)
Then run the dev server. You might need to run npm install if it errors

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the assignment viewer demo I made.
Open [http://localhost:3000/example](http://localhost:3000/example) to see the simple example query demo

You can modify the query for the example by changing the const ENDPOINT in /pages/example.tsx [https://github.com/shanecranor/canvas-assignment-viewer/blob/main/pages/example.tsx#L17](https://github.com/shanecranor/canvas-assignment-viewer/blob/main/pages/example.tsx#L17)
